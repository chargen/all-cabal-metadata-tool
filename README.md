# stackage-metadata

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/commercialhaskell/all-cabal-metadata-tool.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/commercialhaskell/all-cabal-metadata-tool)

Tool for extracting metadata on all packages. Mostly used for
[all-cabal-metadata](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/all-cabal-metadata).
Note that this library will gain some capabilities in the future for projects
looking to read from the all-cabal-metadata repository. One motivating use case
is [Stackage Server](https://www.stackage.org), though command line utilities
would make sense as well.
